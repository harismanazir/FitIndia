Title: Gym Website Frontend – FitIndia (React.js)

Requirements:
Develop a complete frontend in React.js for a gym website named "FitIndia".
The website should have multiple pages and use React Router for navigation.
Make the design modern, visually appealing, and responsive.
Keep the code clean, readable, and well-commented so I can understand it later.
Use a good color scheme (preferably fitness/gym-related colors like dark grey, black, red, white, and orange) and high-quality images.

Pages to Include:

Home Page – Hero banner with an inspiring gym image, tagline, and a “Join Now” button.

About Us – Mission, vision, and history of FitIndia, plus images of facilities.

Programs/Services – List of workout programs (e.g., Yoga, CrossFit, Strength Training, Zumba) with descriptions and images.

Trainers – Profiles of trainers with photos, expertise, and short bios.

Membership Plans – Pricing table for different plans (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly).

Contact Us – Contact form with name, email, message, and a Google Maps embed showing location.

Technical Requirements:

Use React Router v6 for page navigation.

Use functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect).

Use CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS for styling (pick one and stick to it).

Store static content like images in a public assets folder.

Make the layout responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Include a sticky navigation bar and a footer on all pages.

Use dummy data arrays to render repeated items (e.g., trainers, programs).

Comment your code generously to explain logic and structure.

Design Guidelines:

Color scheme: Dark grey/black background with red/orange highlights and white text.

Font: Use Google Fonts (e.g., "Poppins" or "Roboto").

Spacing: Maintain clean margins and paddings.

Buttons: Rounded corners with hover effects.

Images: Use royalty-free fitness images (e.g., from Unsplash or Pexels).

Final Deliverables:

A fully working React.js project with the described pages and routing.

Code should be easy to read and modify.

Include setup instructions in a README.md file.
